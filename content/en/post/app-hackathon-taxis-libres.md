This project arises as a proposal for the hackathon of the company Taxis Libres in the year 2021
in which it was sought to improve the application used by users to make it more attractive.

The solution my team proposed was the integration of IBM artificial intelligence to
translate the conversations that passengers and drivers have in the event that they speak different languages.

## Used Techonologies
* Flutter: developing an application that receives audio
* Huawei Mobile Sevices: Use of Huawei APIs to program mobile applications (maps)
* Node-red: "back end" of the application that receives audio from the application and processes it with the IBM Cloud API
* IBM Cloud: Passes audio to text (speech to text), translates it and artificial intelligence plays audio with the translated text (text to speech).

An inter-institutional group of four students worked on this project, three from systems engineering, and one student from psychology.
