The **Pillar of Autumn (POA)** model rocket is the first project developed by the research hotbed, and is still in development.
 
## What is the project about?
Make a model rocket that flies 100 meters which allows us to test
 
* Electronics: Test electronic system for the transmission of information in real time
* Software: Received data display software
* Parachute: Test free fall detection system and activate parachute
* Engine: Test engine operation and validate it with respect to static tests

## What do we need to launch it?
* Improve Engines: Do more experimentation with engines using better manufacturing techniques and materials
* Release site: Find a site for testing and launching
