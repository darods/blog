The "Small-scale compact mushroom cultivation system with built-in irrigation" (A.K.A: mushroom-machine) is a proposal with which we won the UN Robot 2020 innovation challenge. It consists of a semi-automatic mushroom cultivation machine designed for People living in war zones.
 
## Problem Statement
 
Malnutrition problems worldwide are one of the biggest problems of
humanity, many times caused by limitations that individuals have to
obtain nutritious and low-cost food in adverse conditions such as
armed conflict, climate, poverty, among other things. The latest estimates indicate that
in 2018 about 821 million people in the world suffered from malnutrition; or what is what
same, 1 in 10 human beings. In fact, hunger and malnutrition are the main risk
health worldwide, even greater than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.
This problem not only affects people's health, but also their quality of life,
opportunities for progress, etc... which is why it is one of the main challenges to solve in
our society.

## Proposal
Considering the problems described above, it is necessary to find new ways
food production that requires few resources and produces great benefits
nutritional and economic. A viable option that does not require a large amount of resources, is easy to produce, and contains great nutritional value is edible mushrooms, considering that neither tracts of land nor a large capital investment are required for their production, as well as taking advantage of agronomic waste. .
 
Since large-scale production is difficult to achieve in scarcity environments, it is
proposes a design of small-scale crops that allows families or small
communities obtain this food source. This objective would be achieved with cultivation units
as shown in the following image.

## Results
The proposal won first place in the UN Robot 2020 innovation competition.
