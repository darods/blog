I played a role in creating a fun race video game using Unity, working as a game developer. My tasks included shaping how the player moves, setting up the camera to follow the action, and assisting with the character AI to navigate the race tracks smoothly.

## What is it about?
Our game transports you to the free and relaxed atmosphere of the sunny beaches, where our protagonist, the coconut Lowin Coconut, is born. With a friendly, charismatic appearance and happy expression. Lowin Coconut radiates an energetic personality. Although you might think that his personality was too relaxed and lazy due to the environment in which he grew up, Lowin is far from that. Our intrepid protagonist always dreamed of being the winner of The Fastest Fruit grand prize, which is held annually on three incredible but demanding tracks. Only the best racers participate, those who have demonstrated their incredible abilities of speed and skill.
