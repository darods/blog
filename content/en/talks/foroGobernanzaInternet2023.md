I participated as a speaker in the _10 Internet Governance Forum_ giving a workshop in which i aim to provide an overview on how the use of blockchain networks can reveal detailed information about people's financial movements, platforms, and habits. In addition, strategies for converting transactions that are pseudo-anonymous to completely anonymous will be explored. Finally, an analysis will be carried out of the relevance of the policies currently implemented and those pending implementation with regard to the governance of these assets and the prevention of their use in criminal activities and the consequences of these.
