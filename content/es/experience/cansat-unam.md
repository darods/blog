This is the "CanSat" picosatellite presented by my ATL seedbed team, with which we obtained position #14 in the competition (close to 200 initial teams).
 
## What is it about?
The objective is the design of a picosatellite that meets the requirements set forth in the
Ibero-American competition of canned satellites of the UNAM. The idea is that this satellite is raised in a drone to 400 meters above ground level and then released. While in free fall, it has to send information from its sensors in real time to a ground station that graphs and stores this data.
 
Upon reaching 200 meters, the satellite has to activate a recovery system (in our proposal, a gyroplane) that slows down so that its payload (an egg) does not suffer damage when it reaches the ground.
