      <description>Click here for demo&#xA;This project arises as a proposal for the hackathon of the company Taxis Libres in the year 2021 in which it was sought to improve the application used by users to make it more attractive.&#xA;The solution my team proposed was the integration of IBM artificial intelligence to translate the conversations that passengers and drivers have in the event that they speak different languages.&#xA;Used Techonologies Flutter: developing an application that receives audio Huawei Mobile Sevices: Use of Huawei APIs to program mobile applications (maps) Node-red: &amp;ldquo;back end&amp;rdquo; of the application that receives audio from the application and processes it with the IBM Cloud API IBM Cloud: Passes audio to text (speech to text), translates it and artificial intelligence plays audio with the translated text (text to speech).</description>

The objective is the design of a picosatellite that meets the requirements set forth in the Ibero-American competition of canned satellites of the UNAM. The idea is that this satellite is raised in a drone to 400 meters above ground level and then released.</description>
