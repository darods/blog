      <description>lightning counter It counts how many lightning strikes there are in thunderstorm images using two types of algorithms, convolutional neural networks and a fuzzy logic algorithm optimized with a genetic algorithm technique.&#xA;Click here to go to the repository&#xA;Click here to see the scientific article&#xA;Click here to see the poster&#xA;What is it for? Electrical storms are one of the most devastating natural phenomena that exist, every year millions of dollars are lost in repairing the damage caused by lightning in the areas where it strikes, either due to loss of equipment, infrastructure or the same damage to nature that are required to be mitigated, as is the case of forest fires.</description>

      <description>Click here for demo&#xA;This project arises as a proposal for the hackathon of the company Taxis Libres in the year 2021 in which it was sought to improve the application used by users to make it more attractive.&#xA;The solution my team proposed was the integration of IBM artificial intelligence to translate the conversations that passengers and drivers have in the event that they speak different languages.&#xA;Used Techonologies Flutter: developing an application that receives audio Huawei Mobile Sevices: Use of Huawei APIs to program mobile applications (maps) Node-red: &amp;ldquo;back end&amp;rdquo; of the application that receives audio from the application and processes it with the IBM Cloud API IBM Cloud: Passes audio to text (speech to text), translates it and artificial intelligence plays audio with the translated text (text to speech).</description>

      <description>Video&#xA;The &amp;ldquo;Small-scale compact mushroom cultivation system with built-in irrigation&amp;rdquo; (A.K.A: mushroom-machine) is a proposal with which we won the UN Robot 2020 innovation challenge. It consists of a semi-automatic mushroom cultivation machine designed for People living in war zones.&#xA;Problem Statement Malnutrition problems worldwide are one of the biggest problems of humanity, many times caused by limitations that individuals have to obtain nutritious and low-cost food in adverse conditions such as armed conflict, climate, poverty, among other things.</description>

      <description>This is the &amp;ldquo;CanSat&amp;rdquo; picosatellite presented by my ATL seedbed team, with which we obtained position #14 in the competition (close to 200 initial teams).&#xA;What is it about? The objective is the design of a picosatellite that meets the requirements set forth in the Ibero-American competition of canned satellites of the UNAM. The idea is that this satellite is raised in a drone to 400 meters above ground level and then released.</description>
